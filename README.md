# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lars Karbo. I have been coding since I learned how to create websites as a kid. Please do not find any of that old code.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

* Full stack neuroengineer at Drowzee. Creating a brain training platform. Working with react native, making and app that processes signals from the brain (EEG) and gives real time feedback.
* Working on my own projects (lots of stuff coming up). Indie hacking, SaaS, rapid prototyping.
* TikTok? (shh, this is still a secret)
* Learning music (ableton).
