# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you â˜•

My name is Lars Karbo. I have been coding since I learned how to create websites as a kid.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

* Full stack neuroengineer at Drowzee. Creating a brain training platform. Working with react native, making and app that processes signals from the brain (EEG) and gives real time feedback.
* Working on my own projects (lots of stuff coming up). Indie hacking, SaaS, rapid prototyping.
* Started sharing some of my projects and my dev world on [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@larskarbo). This is a step in a strategy of increasing my online prescence and decrease my own (irrational) fear of sharing. Also check out my website: https://larskarbo.no/ and my [twitter](https://twitter.com/larskarbo): 

Other stuff:

* Learning music (ableton).
* Learning french ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.


**I have a pretty nice blog here: https://larskarbo.no/**
